                    <p class="text-muted"> Many people worry about losing their homes, causing them to make ill-advised decisions, such as handing over their properties to their children during their lifetime. This is something we strongly recommend you do not do, as once you have given your home away, you have lost control over it.  If your children were to divorce, become bankrupt, or die, the security of your home would be under threat.</p>
    
                    <p class="text-muted"> A <strong>Home Protection Trust</strong> is a type of ‘safe’ which is designed to protect your home and savings, against any risks that could happen in years to come. The law dictates that the assets are held by the Trust rather than you directly (the trust holds the assets on your behalf), therefore you are protected against anything that may endanger the security of your home or savings in years to come.  You still have complete control and can move, sell or invest as before.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-muted"> By transferring your home and assets into a trust, you can continue living in the property for the rest of your life and you become the Trustee.  Although the trust then owns the property, you retain all the benefits and flexibility of owning your own home, meaning you can sell the property at any time or move to a smaller property with the trust still in place.  When you pass away, the property passes to the beneficiaries named in your Will.</p>

                                    <li>  Any asset held within a Trust usually passes to the beneficiaries within 28 days of death and do not need to go through Probate</li>
                             
                                    <li>  If beneficiaries are divorcing at the time of your death and were to inherit part (or all) of your Estate, this would form part of their divorce settlement and they would lose that share</li>
                                   
                                    <li>  Beneficiaries would lose State benefits if they inherited a lump sum with disabled or dependent relatives potentially losing their home if not left to them in a trust</li>
                                    
                                    <li>  You may have disinherited a child for some reason, unless your assets are held in trust for six years prior to your death, they could make a claim against your Estate, and quite probably win</li>
                                   
                                    <li>  Your children may have an inheritance tax (IHT) issue of their own. By leaving their inheritance in trust, it will not form part of their Estate so not attracting IHT</li>
                                    
                                    <li>  If you died and your spouse remarried, everything you had worked for could pass to another family, leaving out your children. This is known as sideways disinheritance</li>

                            <p class="text-muted"> By placing your assets into trust during your lifetime, all these pitfalls can be avoided.  It takes around 4 – 6 weeks to set up a Home Protection Trust, and once completed, you still own the assets, albeit they are protected by the trust.  You can still buy and sell property, cash in or re-invest investments or change your Will at any time.</p>
                                
                            <p class="text-muted"> There are certain tax implications that come into play when setting up a scheme of this nature.
