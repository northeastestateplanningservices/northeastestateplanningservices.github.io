                    <p class="text-muted"> Many people worry about losing their homes, causing them to make ill-advised decisions, such as handing over their properties to their children during their lifetime. This is something we strongly recommend you do not do, as once you have given your home away, you have lost control over it.  If your children were to divorce, become bankrupt, or die, the security of your home would be under threat.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-muted"> There are two main types of trust to be considered when looking at asset protection.</p>
    
                    <p class="text-muted"> A <strong>Home Protection Trust</strong> is a type of ‘safe’ which is designed to protect your home and savings, against any risks that could happen in years to come. The law dictates that the assets are held by the Trust rather than you directly (the trust holds the assets on your behalf), therefore you are protected against anything that may endanger the security of your home or savings in years to come.  You still have complete control and can move, sell or invest as before.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-muted"> A <strong>Protective Property Trust (PPT)</strong> can be established which will help to protect your estate from being taken to pay for care home fees.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-muted">The Property Trust can only be created whilst both partners remain alive. Normally with couples the property is divided 50/50, though these percentages can be different. Upon the first death, their share of the property is placed into the Trust to be administered by the Trustees.</p>                   
                    
                    <p class="text-muted">The Will also specifies who is to be the ultimate beneficiary of this share in the property and this would normally be the surviving children of the deceased. The surviving partner, under the terms of the Trust, has the right to remain living in the property for the rest of their life, or even buy another property.</p>                   
                    
                    <p class="text-muted">On the death of the second partner the Trust comes to an end and the property passes absolutely to the beneficiaries. The surviving partner does not own the deceased's share of the property.</p>

                        <p class="text-muted"> By transferring your home and assets into a trust, you can continue living in the property for the rest of your life and you become the Trustee.  Although the trust then owns the property, you retain all the benefits and flexibility of owning your own home, meaning you can sell the property at any time or move to a smaller property with the trust still in place.  When you pass away, the property passes to the beneficiaries named in your Will.</p>
                    
                            <p class="text-muted"> <strong>Although you may feel you have a very robust Will in place, if you have not protected your assets during your lifetime, there may be nothing left to leave to your loved ones by the time you pass away.</strong>  By transferring your assets into a trust during your lifetime, your trust will ensure that your beneficiaries benefit from your lifetime of hard work.</p>

                            <p class="text-muted">There are lots of other benefits too, including:</p>

                                    <li>  Any asset held within a Trust usually passes to the beneficiaries within 28 days of death and do not need to go through Probate</li>
                             
                                    <li>  If beneficiaries are divorcing at the time of your death and were to inherit part (or all) of your Estate, this would form part of their divorce settlement and they would lose that share</li>
                                   
                                    <li>  Beneficiaries would lose State benefits if they inherited a lump sum with disabled or dependent relatives potentially losing their home if not left to them in a trust</li>
                                    
                                    <li>  You may have disinherited a child for some reason, unless your assets are held in trust for six years prior to your death, they could make a claim against your Estate, and quite probably win</li>
                                   
                                    <li>  Your children may have an inheritance tax (IHT) issue of their own. By leaving their inheritance in trust, it will not form part of their Estate so not attracting IHT</li>
                                    
                                    <li>  If you died and your spouse remarried, everything you had worked for could pass to another family, leaving out your children. This is known as sideways disinheritance</li>
                                   
                            </ul>

                            <p class="text-muted"> By placing your assets into trust during your lifetime, all these pitfalls can be avoided.  It takes around 4 – 6 weeks to set up a Home Protection Trust, and once completed, you still own the assets, albeit they are protected by the trust.  You can still buy and sell property, cash in or re-invest investments or change your Will at any time.</p>
                                
                            <p class="text-muted"> There are certain tax implications that come into play when setting up a scheme of this nature.  At North east estate planning, our experienced and friendly consultants will guide you through the process, explaining any tax implications as they may arise, thereby ensuring you have a full understanding of what you are doing, before you do it.
